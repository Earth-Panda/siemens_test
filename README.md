# Project Overview

**Name:** Jason Heng

I structured this project as it would be in a real-world application. I used VS Code in a C++ environment on Windows to debug and write this code.

## File Structure

- **main.c/h**: Contains the main functions that were required for me to write.
- **uart.c/h**: Contains empty functions for UART communication.
- **sensorAPI.c/h**: Contains empty functions for handling the temperature and accelerometer sensors.
- **unitTest.c/h**: Contains the unit test functions.

Thank you for considering my application. Please email me if you have any questions.
